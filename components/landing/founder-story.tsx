                A few months ago, I was struggling to validate my SaaS ideasâ€”getting stuck in analysis paralysis and wasting weeks on ideas that weren't viable.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                â€¢ First attempt: Too niche, no market.
                <br />â€¢ Second attempt: Too competitive without differentiation.
                <br />â€¢ Third attempt: Found a good idea but spent weeks on manual research.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                That's when I realized: idea validation is broken for creators and founders. Why should validating ideas take weeks when AI could do it in minutes?
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Now, I've built AgentsOnGear to help founders and product builders validate ideas quickly with real dataâ€”not just guesswork or outdated information.
